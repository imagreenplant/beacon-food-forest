                We are on land stolen from the Duwamish, Suquamish, Muckleshoot, and other peoples, stewards and co-creators of abundance with the land since time immemorial. We work to dismantle an unjust food system rooted in white supremacy and conquest by nurturing its replacement, already alive and ready to grow. Through open harvest and collaboration within and among communities, we work to create a fair share for all.

                What is a Food Forest?
        </h2>
        <p>A food forest is a gardening technique or land management system, which mimics a woodland ecosystem by substituting edible trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals. Fruit and nut trees make up the upper level, while berry shrubs, edible perennials and annuals make up the lower levels. The Beacon Food Forest will combine aspects of native habitat rehabilitation with edible forest gardening.
            <br/>
            <br/>The goal of the Beacon Food Forest is to bring the richly diverse community together by fostering a Permaculture Tree Guild approach to urban farming and land stewardship. By building a community around sharing food with the public we hope to be inclusive to all in need of food.
            <br/>
            <br/>The Food Forest is set to include an
            <span class="text-bold">Edible Arboretum</span> with fruits gathered from regions around the world, a
            <span class="text-bold">Berry Patch</span> for canning, gleaning and picking, a
            <span class="text-bold">Nut Grove</span> with trees providing shade and sustenance, a
            <span class="text-bold">Community Garden</span> using the p-patch model for families to grow their own food, a
            <span class="text-bold">Gathering Plaza</span> for celebration and education, a
            <span class="text-bold">Kid's Area</span> for eduction and play and a
            <span class="text-bold">Living Gateway</span> to connect and serve as portals as you meander through the forest.
            <br/>
            <br/>The Beacon Food Forest started in 2009 as a final design project for a permaculture design course. The 5+ acre site is located in the Beacon Hill neighborhood to the west of Jefferson Park, 2.5 miles from downtown Seattle. Phase One (1.75 acres) is complete, and we are now planning for Phase Two (1.75 acres).
