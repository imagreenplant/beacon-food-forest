        Welcome

    <p>The goal of the Beacon Food Forest is to design, plant and grow an edible urban forest garden that inspires our community to gather together, grow our own food and rehabilitate our local ecosystem.
        <br>
        <br>Join us to improve public health by regenerating our public land into an edible forest ecosystem. We work to reduce agricultural climate impact, improve our local food security, provide educational opportunities, and celebrate growing food for the benefit of all species.

        <br>
        <br>Please support the Beacon Food Forest by getting involved, donating and spreading the word.

        What is a Food Forest?
    </div>
    <!-- contentitle -->
    <p>A food forest is a gardening technique or land management system, which mimics a woodland ecosystem by substituting edible trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals. Fruit and nut trees make up the upper level, while berry shrubs, edible perennials and annuals make up the lower levels. The Beacon Food Forest will combine aspects of native habitat rehabilitation with edible forest gardening.
        <br>
        <br>The goal of the Beacon Food Forest is to bring the richly diverse community together by fostering a Permaculture Tree Guild approach to urban farming and land stewardship. By building a community around sharing food with the public we hope to be inclusive to all in need of food.
        <br>
        <br>The Food Forest is set to include an
        <span class="text-bold">Edible Arboretum</span> with fruits gathered from regions around the world, a
        <span class="text-bold">Berry Patch</span> for canning, gleaning and picking, a
        <span class="text-bold">Nut Grove</span> with trees providing shade and sustenance, a
        <span class="text-bold">Community Garden</span> using the p-patch model for families to grow their own food, a
        <span class="text-bold">Gathering Plaza</span> for celebration and education, a
        <span class="text-bold">Kid's Area</span> for eduction and play and a
        <span class="text-bold">Living Gateway</span> to connect and serve as portals as you meander through the forest.
        <br>
        <br>The Beacon Food Forest started in 2009 as a final design project for a permaculture design course. The 7-acre site is located in the Beacon Hill neighborhood to the west of Jefferson Park, 2.5 miles from downtown Seattle. Phase One (2 acres) is scheduled to be up and running by early 2014.
