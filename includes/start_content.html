		How We Got Started

<p>
<span class="text-bold">Step 1: Find the land. </span>
<br><span class="text-green">Permaculture Principle: Observe and Interact</span></span>
<br>The land the BFF is stewarding is on Beacon Hill, Seattle WA. and is owned by Seattle Public Utilities (SPU). This is public utility rate payer land and  because the area around our site houses a city water reservoir it is considered water quality land where strict rules apply to protect our city's water quality. The BFF is adjacent to, Jefferson Park which is maintained by Seattle Parks and Recreation Department ("Parks").  The Parks Department is under a land use agreement with SPU to maintain Jefferson Park.  Jefferson Park was a 20 year community volunteer design effort and a success story in itself.

<span class="text-bold">Step 2: Find a core group of dedicated believers. </span>
<br><span class="text-green">Permaculture Principle: Integrate rather than segregate.</span></span>
<br>Through outreach, a core group of dedicated believers were found to take part in the project. This group introduced the Beacon Food Forest Concept to the diverse Beacon Hill neighborhood community, where the local public elementary school translates it's newsletter into 50 languages. The Beacon Food Forest recognizes diversity as the definition and essence of a healthy ecosystem and a healthy human community.  
<br><br><br>

<span class="text-bold">Step 3: Introduce the BFF Concept to the Community. </span>
<br><span class="text-green">Permaculture Principle: Use and value diversity.</span></span>
<br>On Ground Hog Day in February of 2010 Glenn Herlihy and Jacqueline Cramer, the two Co-Founders, held the first Beacon Food Forest public meeting at the Lawn Bowling Club House in Jefferson Park to explain the possibilities of starting a food forest. We borrowed as many email lists we could find from the community and posted our notice any where we could. The result was about 30 people coming from a variety of city agencies, community groups and local residents. The end result of the meeting was a very positive response from everyone and the beginning of our email interest list.  Several of the people attending this first meeting continued on and became part of the Beacon Food Forest Steering Committee.
<br><br><br>

<span class="text-bold">Step 4: Create a relationship with the landlord and begin negotiations.  </span>
<br><span class="text-green">Permaculture Principle: Use and value renewable resources and services. </span><br>
<span class="text-green">Permaculture Principle: Apply self regulation and accept feedback.</span></span>
<br>After a positive reception at the first community meeting our next step was to approach SPU the land owners and Seattle Parks and Recreation. Because these two agencies were working together to build Jefferson Park, contacts were available and a meeting / walk-through was arranged with SPU lead Ray Hoffman, other SPU personnel, Kevin Stoops  and Andy Sheffer from Seattle Parks and Recreation, and members of Jefferson Park Alliance, the community group supporting the creation of Jefferson Park. The results were positive but absolutely no commitment was given from either agency and many concerns were expressed about needing an official design by a certified WA State Landscape designer, long term maintenance and whether there was large community support for such a project.  Next steps from this meeting were to meet with internal land management SPU team, apply for a grant to hire a Design Consultant / Landscape Architect and demonstrate to SPU we had widespread community support.  
<br><br>
In applying for a grant from the City of Seattle Department of neighborhoods, we received advice that in order to receive funding support we needed to demonstrate an interest from the community. Christina Olsen led an effort and 'hit the street.' She set up a table at many neighborhood events, and tabled at the local grocery store, sharing the vision and having people sign up to support the project and receive information. We created a mailing list of 400+ interested individuals. We also talked with numerous community groups for possible collaboration.  
<br><br>
In December of 2010 we received a "Small and Simple" grant from Seattle Department of Neighborhoods for $22,000 to hire a design team and begin creating a schematic design with community input.  By early 2011 we had interviewed four design groups and selected one. The new design team consisted of Margarett Harrison and Jenny Pell.  This team would work alongside the Friends of the Beacon Food Forest and facilitated 3 public meetings to gather community ideas on what we would like to see in a community garden/food forest.  
<br><br>
The grant also included a budget for outreach material which we used to print 6000 postcards in five languages to be mass mailed to zip codes surrounding the BFF site.  We created our own posters and scheduled BFF information tables at grocery stores, community festivals and events, garden walks, you name it we had a table there. The result was  70 people at the first meeting, 95 at the second and over 120 at the third. These people were from the diverse local community and city wide. Our email list was growing and many local food activists were jumping on board. We were successfully demonstrating community support.
<br><br>


<span class="text-bold">Step 5: Create leverage.  </span>
<br><span class="text-green">Permaculture Principle: Creatively use and respond to change.</span></span>
<br>The schematic design held a lot of leverage, drawn by a certified Landscape Architect, fit the actual topography of the site, had massive community support and input, and in the end demonstrated a successfully completed grant process.  
<br><br>
Having completed the Small and Simple Grant and demonstrated community support our city officials were starting to listen to us. At this point SPU was more willing to meet and discuss a land use agreement but had a list of requirements we still needed to fulfill, one of which was an organization that could guarantee long term maintenance of the project. This was the beginning of the creation of the BFF management plan.
<br><br>
<br>


<span class="text-bold">Step 6: Continuous Outreach and Community Engagement. </span> 
<br><span class="text-green">Permaculture Principle: Use edges and value the marginal.</span></span>
<br>Finding allies is essential to creating a large scale urban agriculture project. We started by partnering with other food ecology advocates and  giving tours to university classes of our site. These efforts have resulted in many new volunteers who look to gain hands on experience in the field of their study and programs. 
<br><br>
Outreach to local high schools, elementary schools, church groups, hospitals, Rotary Clubs etc has proven successful in gathering leverage support, grant funding and general involvement. Outreach success was measured by numbers. Our Community Work Parties have been over 100 people from day one. 
<br><br>
Meeting people face to face is absolutely the best outreach but Social Media and mass email updates are very effective at gathering interest and keeping the interest going.  The BFF started with a bang in the media and it has been a lot of work to keep that momentum going but this effort is beneficial to bringing in citywide if not countrywide involvement. By gathering email addresses from interested supporters, we are able to keep in touch easily through our Newsletter. This helps our supporters stay updated on news, events, meetings and how to get involved. <span class="link"><a href="#" onclick="mailListbox_open()">Join Our Mailing List</a></span>.
<br><br><br>


<span class="text-bold">Our Funding</span><br>
The BFF relies on funding through grants and donations.  All of the BFF grants have been written by BFF volunteers. If you are a Grantee and feel our organizations could form a beneficial relationship please <span class="link"><a href="index.html#contactus">contact us</a></span> or please make a <span class="link"><a href="#" onclick="donatebox_open()">donation</a></span>.
<br><br>
In 2012 we received a grant from City Fruit and ACT Trees to buy a small forest of bare root trees and hold workshops on fruit tree care for the community.  These workshops were used to educate people on food forestry and train people to steward trees on public lands. 
<br><br>
We also received a grant from Sustainable Path Foundation in 2012 to create a series of permanent signs explaining  many of the scientific and social benefits to creating an edible forest garden in an urban setting. This signage will be permanent education allowing visitors a self guided tour of food forestry and information on how to get involved.
<br><br>
In 2013 we received another Neighborhood Matching Fund Grant from the Department of Neighborhoods to work with the University of Washington's School of Architecture's Design/Build program to build a gathering/ education/ celebration place on site. These structures were installed in June of 2013.
